## What's Changed

> [!warning]
> üõ†Ô∏è This new approach changes the entire concept of how Pigeon is designed, I have no idea on the consequences and it might make everything a lot worse. Treat with care.

This change introduces support to keep Pigeon running even with partial chain support. The downside is that Pigeons which only want to support a subset of the external chains may now freely do so without getting punished.
